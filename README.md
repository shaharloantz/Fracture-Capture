## Description

FractureCapture is a comprehensive web application designed to improve fracture detection by analyzing X-ray images. Utilizing advanced image processing and deep learning algorithms, our application is capable of detecting, classifying, and localizing fractures across various bone types and anatomical regions, particularly in the upper and lower limbs.

This project aims to address the shortage of skilled radiologists and the limitations of existing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems by providing a versatile tool for medical professionals to diagnose fractures effectively.

## Features

- **Fracture Detection**: Accurately detect the presence of fractures in X-ray images.
- **Fracture Classification**: Classify whether there is a fracture or not in the X-ray images.
- **Fracture Localization**: Accurately localize and visually represent detected fractures.
- **Web Application Integration**: Upload and analyze X-ray images through a user-friendly interface.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Near real-time processing of uploaded images.
- **Versatility**: Handles fractures in both upper and lower limbs.
- **Scalability and Accessibility**: Designed to accommodate varying workload demands and accessible from any internet-enabled device.
- **High Accuracy**: Ensures reliable results for users.
- **Security**: Implements user authentication to protect data and ensure privacy.
- **User Feedback**: Provides clear analysis results to users.
